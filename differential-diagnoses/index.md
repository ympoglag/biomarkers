Disorders, Diseases or Issues I am checking out, in hopes of getting some
diagnosis via Exclusion.

## Category - Pulmonary

### Chest-wall inflammation (costochondritis)
Sharp pain in the front/side of the chest, often worse with deep breaths, movement, or when pressing on a tender spot. Usually benign but can be quite painful.

### Pleurisy (inflamed lung lining)
Often post-viral: sharp, localized pain that worsens with breathing/coughing. Needs a check to rule out other causes.

### Pericarditis (heart lining inflammation)
Sharp pain that worsens lying down or with deep breaths and eases when sitting up/leaning forward.

### Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung)
The most serious common cause of pleuritic pain—risk is elevated for months after COVID-19, so it must be considered.

### Myocarditis

### POTS

#### Exclusion via

A spinal fluid leak (called spontaneous intracranial hypotension) may have the
same signs and symptoms as POTS and should be excluded.[22]

Other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as dehydration,
orthostatic hypotension, heart problems, adrenal insufficiency, epilepsy, and
Parkinson's disease, must not be present.[6]


### MCAS

### Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak

##### **2. Beta-2 Transferrin Test**

* **Gold standard biochemical test**
    
* This protein is almost exclusively found in CSF.
    
* A sample of nasal or ear discharge is collected and tested — if positive, it confirms the presence of CSF.
