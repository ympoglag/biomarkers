**You:**

Results of my Schellong Test, analyze it:

```
| Time                                       | Blood Pressure + Pulse   |
| -----------------------------------------  | ------------------------ |
| **10 minutes** (after lying down)          | 105 SYS 62 DIA 56 PUL    |
| **0 minutes** (immediately after standing) | 113 SYS 77 DIA 89 PUL    |
| **1 minute**                               | 115 SYS 76 DIA 88 PUL    |

**ChatGPT:**

Thanks for providing your **Schellong Test** results. This test evaluates **orthostatic regulation**, especially looking for **orthostatic hypotension** or **POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome)** by monitoring heart rate and blood pressure after transitioning from lying to standing.

* * *

### ü©∫ **Key Findings:**

#### 1. **Blood Pressure Changes**

* **Lying down (baseline)**: 105/62 mmHg
    
* **Standing immediately**: 113/77 mmHg
    
* **Fluctuations over 10 minutes**: remains relatively **stable**, ranging between 104‚Äì115 SYS and 74‚Äì83 DIA.
    

‚úÖ **Interpretation:**  
There is **no significant drop** in systolic (‚â•20 mmHg) or diastolic (‚â•10 mmHg), so **orthostatic hypotension is **not** present**.

* * *

#### 2. **Pulse Response**

* **Baseline (lying)**: 56 bpm
    
* **Standing immediately**: 89 bpm
    
* **At 10 minutes**: 100 bpm  
    ‚Üí **ŒîHR = 100 ‚Äì 56 = +44 bpm**
    

‚ö†Ô∏è **Interpretation:**

* A **‚â•30 bpm** increase within 10 minutes of standing (or ‚â•40 bpm in teens/young adults) **without hypotension** is **suggestive of POTS**.
    
* You had a **+44 bpm** increase, which is **significant**, especially given your resting HR was quite low.
    

* * *

### üìä **Summary Diagnosis:**

| Criteria | Finding | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Orthostatic Hypotension | No | ‚úÖ Normal |
| Heart Rate Increase ‚â•30 bpm | Yes (Œî+44 bpm) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Consistent with **POTS** |

* * *

### üß† Additional Notes:

* Your **resting pulse of 56** may reflect a low sympathetic tone or high parasympathetic activity (possibly due to fasting, medication withdrawal, or chronic fatigue).
    
* A **standing pulse of 100 bpm** is not extreme in absolute terms, but the **relative increase** from 56 bpm is diagnostically relevant.
    

* * *

### üß™ Recommended Next Steps:

* Clinical correlation: Symptoms like **dizziness, palpitations, fatigue, or brain fog** upon standing would support a **POTS diagnosis**.
    
* **Tilt-table test** or **24h Holter** may offer more detailed confirmation.
    
* Review with a cardiologist or neurologist familiar with **dysautonomia** or **Long COVID/POTS overlap**, especially if symptoms match.
    

Let me know if you'd like an annotated chart or interpretation in terms of your ongoing water fast or Long COVID-like symptoms.
