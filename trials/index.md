## [Planned]
### Low Dose Naltrexone LDN (Rx)

**Suspected**: LC,MCAS(?),PFS(?)

### Prozac (Rx)
Low dose therapy (e.g. 1-2.5mg) is supposed to increase Allopregnanolone without
actually messing with Serotonin (heavily risking SSRI side effects).

> For me personally I’d say it doesn’t make a huge difference to side effects - it gets rid of the depression day and I think improves sleep somewhat. I haven’t noticed any effect on brain fog or sexual side effects.

## [Previous]
### ALCAR 1000-3000mg (Sup)
Helped for postulized SFN.  
Gave me more sensation on the body.  
No significant mental benefits/differences.  

**Suspected**: LC,PFS,ADHD

### Guanfacine (Rx)
1mg/2mg  
Tried over 2 months.  
Did nothing.

**Prescription-for**: ADHD

### Melatonin
Raised my Prolactine.  
Helped falling asleep, not staying asleep.  
Did not noticably improve sleep quality.  
Gave me slight headaches in the morning/rest of the day.  
Stopped positive effects once my sleep schedule "settled" into a new regular.

**Suspected**: ADHD,SLEEP

### Xyzal
Unsure if it did something.  
Should try again over longer periods and track symptoms.

**Suspected**: MCAS

## [Considering]
### Butyric acid (Sup)
...

### Lactoferrin (Sup)
It has well-known antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties.  

**Immunomodulation**: It can modulate immune responses, sometimes helping calm
hyperinflammation ("cytokine storm") seen in Long Covid.

Small studies and case reports suggest lactoferrin might help reduce some
symptoms of Long Covid, especially fatigue, brain fog, and GI symptoms.

**Mechanistic studies**: Lab research supports antiviral and anti-inflammatory
effects, including against SARS-CoV-2.

**Clinical trials**: As of 2024, there are few large, high-quality randomized
controlled trials specifically for Long Covid. However, some open-label studies
and anecdotal reports are promising.

**Suspected**: PFS,LC
