### HYLO GEL
Eye drops that coat the eye better.
Used as needed, sometimes multiple times a day.

### Lactoferrin (Sup)
1000mg Liposomal  
1x a day  

For 1 month.

It has well-known antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties.  

**Immunomodulation**: It can modulate immune responses, sometimes helping calm
hyperinflammation ("cytokine storm") seen in Long Covid.

Small studies and case reports suggest lactoferrin might help reduce some
symptoms of Long Covid, especially fatigue, brain fog, and GI symptoms.

**Mechanistic studies**: Lab research supports antiviral and anti-inflammatory
effects, including against SARS-CoV-2.

**Clinical trials**: As of 2024, there are few large, high-quality randomized
controlled trials specifically for Long Covid. However, some open-label studies
and anecdotal reports are promising.

**Suspected**: LC,PFS

## [Paused]

### Vyvanse (Rx)
15-30mg  
Split into 1-3 dosages (still experimenting).  
Have been taking for 4+ years.  
Effectiveness has been reduced over time (radically since having had COVID19).

**Unsure if Helps anymore**

**Prescription-for**: ADHD

## [Planned]
### Low Dose Naltrexone LDN (Rx)

**Suspected**: LC,MCAS(?),PFS(?)

### Prozac (Rx)
Low dose therapy (e.g. 1-2.5mg) is supposed to increase Allopregnanolone without
actually messing with Serotonin (heavily risking SSRI side effects).
