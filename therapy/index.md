### Nicotine Patches
10mg - 16 hours  
Every 16 hours continuously for 9 days.

04.08.25 - 11.08.25

Got some good initial reactions out of it.  
Flattened after a while - continued for a bit - felt like a very mild
stimulant.

### Prozac (Rx)
Low dose therapy (e.g. 1-2.5mg) is supposed to increase Allopregnanolone without
actually messing with Serotonin (heavily risking SSRI side effects).

## [Considering]

## [Ignored]
### Lactoferrin (Sup)
Long COVID RCT (2024): 72 outpatients took 1,200 mg/day bovine LF for 6 weeks vs
placebo—no significant improvement in fatigue, anxiety/depression, cognitive
failure, or physical performance. (Good safety.)

### Butyric acid (Sup)
Activates PPAR-α - however causes bad smells and strongly irritates the stomach.  
PPAR-α is also activated by PEA-LUT without the above issues.
